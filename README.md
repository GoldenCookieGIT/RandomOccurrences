# ARCHIVE -- OWNER NOTE
This is the first plugin I created after learning kotlin. It was fun while it lasted but since I'm a fulltime student I am unable to maintain it or provide support anymore. Please consider other plugins instead of this one. If you still incline on using this one, be wary that there are a bunch of bugs that WONT be fixed.
